# External Integration: Bike Monitoring System

## Purpose: *Simulates external IoT/monitoring system that detects bike issues.*

### Core Concepts
Issue Detection: Automated identification of bike problems
Monitoring Trigger: BikeMarkedAsInUse event initiates monitoring

### Integration Flow
Listens for **BikeMarkedAsInUse** events
Simulates condition analysis
Automatically triggers RequestBikeReplacement command

### Business Rules
- Monitoring activates when bike usage begins
- Issues are detected automatically (simulated)
- System autonomously requests replacements

# External Integration: Extension Processing System
## Purpose: *Handles rental time extension requests through external processing.*

### Core Concepts
Rental Extension: Additional time added to rental
Additional Time: Minutes to add to rental period
Approved Time: Validated extension duration

### Integration Flow
- Listens for RentalExtensionRequested events
- Processes extension request (external validation)
- Sends ApproveRentalExtension command with approved time

### Commands
**ApproveRentalExtension**: Confirm extension with approved duration

### Events
**RentalExtensionRequested**: Extension request initiated

### Event Tags and Aggregates
The system uses two primary aggregate identifiers:
Bike Aggregate (@EventTag(key = "Bike"))

Events tagged with bike identifier for bike-centric operations:
- **BikeCreated**
- **BikeMarkedAsAvailable**
- **BikeRemovedFromFleet**
- **BikeMarkedAsInUse**
- **BikeReplacementRequested**

Rental Aggregate (@EventTag(key = "Rental"))
Events tagged with rental identifier for rental-centric operations:
- **BikeRentalRequested**
- **RentalRequestRejectedTimeout**
- **RentalRequestRejectedCancellation**
- **PaymentPrepared**
- **PaymentCompleted**
- **PaymentFailed**
- **PaymentCancelled**
- **RentalPaused**
- **RentalResumed**
- **RentalEndedEarly**
- **ExtraFeesChargedExtendedPause**
- **BikeReturned**
- **BikePhotoSubmitted**
- **PhotoFlaggedForReview**
- **BikeInspectionCompleted**
- **ReturnSurveySubmitted**
- **RentalExtensionRequested**
- **ReplacementBikeAssigned**

### Cross-Cutting Concepts
Event Sourcing
All state entities (@EventSourcedEntity) rebuild state from historical events using @EventSourcingHandler methods.

Event Criteria
Components use @EventCriteriaBuilder to define which events reconstruct their state, filtering by tags and event types.

Command Gateway
Used for asynchronous command dispatch, particularly in integration scenarios and deadline scheduling.

Processing Context
Enables commands to be sent within the same transaction context as event processing.

Virtual Thread Executor
Used for deadline scheduling (timeouts) without blocking threads.

# Suggested Improvements
1. Missing Rental Extension Command Handler
The system has RentalExtensionRequested event and ApproveRentalExtension command, but no command handler to process the approval. Add a command handler in a rental extension management component.

2. Inconsistent Exception Handling
Some handlers use IllegalStateException, others use custom exceptions like BikeAlreadyReserved
Recommendation: Create a consistent exception hierarchy (e.g., BikeRentalException, PaymentException, etc.)

3. Magic Numbers
Hardcoded values should be externalized:
10-minute payment timeout
30-minute pause timeout
$5 extended pause fee
Recommendation: Move to application.yml configuration

4. Missing Saga Coordination
The system would benefit from Axon Sagas to orchestrate complex workflows:
Complete rental workflow (request → payment → usage → return)
Bike replacement workflow (issue detection → request → assignment)
Recommendation: Implement saga patterns for multi-step processes

5. Lack of Compensation Logic
No explicit compensation/rollback mechanisms for failed operations:
What happens if bike replacement fails?
How to handle partial payment completion?
Recommendation: Add compensating transactions

6. Simulated External Systems
BikeMonitoringSystemIntegration and ExtensionProcessingSystemIntegration always trigger actions:
Recommendation: Add configuration to disable/mock for testing
Consider adding conditional logic or feature flags

7. Missing Query Side (CQRS)
No projection handlers or query models for read operations:
Recommendation: Add @EventHandler projections to maintain read models
Implement query endpoints for fleet status, rental history, etc.

8. Incomplete Validation
Many commands lack comprehensive validation:
No null checks on required fields
No format validation (e.g., phone numbers, payment methods)
Recommendation: Add JSR-303 Bean Validation annotations

9. Thread Safety in Deadline Scheduling
Virtual thread executor is shared static field:
Recommendation: Make it a Spring-managed bean with proper lifecycle

10. Missing Business Metrics
No monitoring or metrics collection:
Recommendation: Add Micrometer metrics for key operations (rental success rate, payment failures, average rental duration)

11. Event Versioning Strategy
No apparent strategy for event schema evolution:
Recommendation: Implement upcasters for event versioning
Add version fields to events

12. Inconsistent Logging Levels
Some operations use info, others use debug:
Recommendation: Establish logging standards (errors for failures, info for business events, debug for technical details)

13. Missing API Documentation
Controllers lack OpenAPI/Swagger annotations:
Recommendation: Add SpringDoc OpenAPI annotations for API documentation

14. Incomplete Return Flow
Return survey submission doesn't seem to complete the rental:
Recommendation: Add final rental completion event and command

15. No Idempotency Handling
Commands could be processed multiple times:
Recommendation: Implement idempotency checks using command message IDs

16. Missing Integration Tests
Only command handlers and controllers visible, no test files:
Recommendation: Add integration tests using Axon Test fixtures

17. Database Schema Management
Using ddl-auto: create will drop tables on restart:
Recommendation: Use Flyway or Liquibase for production-ready schema management

18. Missing Security
No authentication or authorization visible:
Recommendation: Add Spring Security with role-based access control

19. Error Recovery
No dead letter queue or error handling strategy:
Recommendation: Configure Axon event processor error handlers and DLQ

20. Missing Rate Limiting
API endpoints have no rate limiting:
Recommendation: Add rate limiting for public endpoints using Spring Cloud Gateway or Resilience4j


*“What are the Dynamic Consistency Boundaries?”*


# Dynamic Consistency Boundaries in Jupiter Wheels

## Overview
Dynamic Consistency Boundaries define the scope within which the system maintains immediate consistency through synchronous operations, while allowing eventual consistency across boundaries. In event-sourced systems like Jupiter Wheels, these boundaries determine which operations must succeed or fail atomically.

### Identified Consistency Boundaries
1. Bike Fleet Boundary

Aggregate Root: BikeId

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Bike creation and initial availability marking (atomic transaction)
Bike status transitions (CREATED → AVAILABLE → REMOVED)
Bike removal validation (must check current status)

Event Criteria:

```kotlin
EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Bike", bikeId))
```

Invariants Protected:
✅ A bike cannot be removed twice
✅ A bike must exist before removal
✅ Bike status is always consistent

Cross-Boundary Interactions (Eventual Consistency):
Bike availability for rental requests
Bike usage status during rentals

2. Bike Rental Request Boundary
Aggregate Root: Composite (userId, bikeId) via TargetIdentifier

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Rental request creation
Bike availability check at request time
Single active reservation per bike validation
Payment timeout enforcement

Event Criteria:
```kotlin
EventCriteria.either(
    EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Bike", bikeId))
        .andBeingOneOfTypes(BikeCreated, BikeRemovedFromFleet),
    EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", userId))
        .andBeingOneOfTypes(BikeRentalRequested, RentalRequestRejected...)
)
```

Invariants Protected:
✅ One active rental request per bike at a time
✅ Only available bikes can be rented
✅ Removed bikes cannot be rented

Cross-Boundary Interactions (Eventual Consistency):
Payment processing completion
Bike monitoring system integration
Timeout-based rejections

Design Issue: This boundary spans two aggregate roots (Bike and Rental), creating a complex consistency scope.

3. Payment Processing Boundary

Aggregate Root: RentalId

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Payment preparation
Payment status transitions (PENDING → PREPARED → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED)
Retry validation (only failed payments can be retried)
State checks before status changes

Criteria:
```kotlin
EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", rentalId))
    .andBeingOneOfTypes(
        BikeRentalRequested,
        PaymentPrepared,
        PaymentCompleted,
        PaymentFailed,
        PaymentCancelled
    )
```

Invariants Protected:
✅ Payment success only confirmed for PREPARED payments
✅ Payment failure only reported for PREPARED payments
✅ Only FAILED payments can be retried
✅ Only PREPARED payments can be cancelled

Cross-Boundary Interactions (Eventual Consistency):
Rental request initiation
Bike usage activation after payment
Timeout-triggered cancellations

4. Bike Usage Management Boundary
Aggregate Root: RentalId

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Usage status transitions (IN_USE → PAUSED → IN_USE)
Pause/resume validation
Pause duration calculation
Early termination validation

Event Criteria:
```kotlin
EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", rentalId))
    .andBeingOneOfTypes(
        BikeMarkedAsInUse,
        PaymentCompleted,
        RentalPaused,
        RentalEndedEarly,
        RentalResumed,
        ExtraFeesChargedExtendedPause
    )
```

Invariants Protected:
✅ Only IN_USE rentals can be paused
✅ Only PAUSED rentals can be resumed
✅ Pause duration accurately calculated
✅ Extra fees applied correctly for extended pauses

Cross-Boundary Interactions (Eventual Consistency):
Payment completion triggering usage
Bike monitoring detecting issues
Extension processing system

5. Bike Return Management Boundary

Aggregate Root: RentalId

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Photo submission tracking
Survey submission tracking
Inspection completion validation
Return location recording

Event Criteria:
```kotlin
EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", rentalId))
    .andBeingOneOfTypes(
        BikePhotoSubmitted,
        BikeReturned,
        ReturnSurveySubmitted,
        PhotoFlaggedForReview,
        BikeInspectionCompleted
    )
```

Invariants Protected:
✅ Photo must be submitted before approval
✅ Inspection requires bike return
✅ Each step tracked independently

Cross-Boundary Interactions (Eventual Consistency):
Bike availability marking (crosses to Fleet boundary)
Inspection results affecting fleet status

6. Bike Replacement Management Boundary

Aggregate Root: RentalId

Strong Consistency Within Boundary:
Replacement request validation
Original bike tracking
Replacement bike assignment

Event Criteria:
```kotlin
EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", rentalId))
    .andBeingOneOfTypes(
        BikeReplacementRequested,
        ReplacementBikeAssigned
    )
```

**Invariants Protected**:
- ✅ Replacement can only be assigned if request exists
- ✅ Original bike ID preserved through replacement

**Cross-Boundary Interactions** (Eventual Consistency):
- Bike monitoring system triggering requests
- Assignment affecting multiple bike statuses

## Boundary Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Command → Event → Command Chain
**Example**: Payment Completion → Bike Usage
```
[Payment Boundary]
  ConfirmPaymentSuccess Command
    ↓ (synchronous within boundary)
  PaymentCompleted Event
    ↓ (asynchronous across boundary)
[Usage Boundary]
  BikeMarkedAsInUse Event
```

**Consistency**: Eventually consistent across boundaries

---

### Pattern 2: Event Handler → Command Gateway
**Example**: Bike Monitoring Integration
```
[Usage Boundary]
  BikeMarkedAsInUse Event
    ↓ (asynchronous)
[External System]
  BikeMonitoringSystemIntegration.detectIssue()
    ↓ (via CommandGateway)
[Replacement Boundary]
  RequestBikeReplacement Command
```

**Consistency**: Eventually consistent, fire-and-forget pattern

---

### Pattern 3: Deadline-Based Cross-Boundary
**Example**: Payment Timeout
```
[Rental Boundary]
  BikeRentalRequested Event
    ↓ (schedule deadline - 10 minutes)
  [Virtual Thread Executor]
    ↓ (asynchronous)
  PaymentTimeout Command
    ↓ (synchronous within boundary)
  RentalRequestRejectedTimeout Event
```

Consistency: Eventually consistent with time-based triggers

Problematic Boundary Crossings
Issue 1: BikeRentalManagementState Spans Two Aggregates
```kotlin
EventCriteria.either(
    EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Bike", bikeId)),      // Bike aggregate
    EventCriteria.havingTags(Tag.of("Rental", userId))     // Rental aggregate
)
```

Problem:
State is reconstructed from events across two different aggregate roots
This creates a wide consistency boundary
Race conditions possible if bike status changes during rental request

Recommendation:
Split into separate projections/read models
Use saga to coordinate across boundaries
Implement optimistic locking

Issue 2: BikeMarkedAsAvailable Crosses Boundaries
Emitted in multiple places:
Bike Fleet Boundary: During bike creation
Bike Return Boundary: After successful inspection

```kotlin
// In BikeFleetManagementCommandHandler
eventAppender.append(BikeMarkedAsAvailableEvent(bikeId))

// In BikeReturnManagementCommandHandler
eventAppender.append(BikeMarkedAsAvailable(bikeId))
```

**Problem**:
- Same event type published from different boundaries
- No clear ownership of bike availability state
- Could cause inconsistencies

**Recommendation**:
- Create separate events: `BikeInitiallyMarkedAsAvailable`, `BikeReturnedAndMarkedAsAvailable`
- Or move availability management to a single dedicated boundary

---

### Issue 3: **RequestBikeReplacement Has Unclear Ownership**

Used by:
1. **Bike Monitoring System** (external integration)
2. **Potentially** by users/admins (REST endpoint exists)

**Problem**:
- Command can originate from multiple sources
- No clear consistency boundary ownership
- Target entity is `originalBikeId` but affects rental state

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify command origin (user-initiated vs. system-initiated)
- Consider splitting into separate commands
- Ensure saga coordinates bike and rental boundaries

---

## Missing Consistency Boundaries

### 1. **Rental Lifecycle Saga (Missing)**

**Recommended Boundary**: Cross-cutting saga coordination

**Should Coordinate**:
Rental Request → Payment → Usage → Return → Completion
Current Issue: These are separate boundaries without explicit coordination

Events to Monitor:
BikeRentalRequested
PaymentCompleted / PaymentFailed
BikeMarkedAsInUse
BikeReturned
BikeInspectionCompleted

Recommendation: Implement RentalLifecycleSaga to:
Track overall rental state
Handle compensations
Ensure rental completes properly
Manage timeout escalations

2. Bike State Synchronization (Missing)
Problem: Bike availability is tracked in multiple boundaries:
BikeFleetManagementState
BikeRentalManagementState

Recommendation: Create dedicated projection/read model:

```kotlin
@EventSourcedEntity
class BikeAvailabilityProjection {
    // Subscribes to all bike-related events
    // Maintains single source of truth for bike availability
}
```

---

# Recommendations for Improving Boundaries

## 1. Implement Saga Pattern

```kotlin
@Saga
class RentalLifecycleSaga {
    @StartSaga
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "rentalId")
    fun on(event: BikeRentalRequested) {
        // Coordinate payment, usage, return
    }
    
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "rentalId")
    fun on(event: PaymentCompleted) {
        // Trigger bike usage
    }
    
    @EndSaga
    @SagaEventHandler(associationProperty = "rentalId")
    fun on(event: BikeInspectionCompleted) {
        // Complete rental lifecycle
    }
}

```

## 2. Add Optimistic Locking

```kotlin
@EventSourcedEntity
class BikeFleetManagementState {
    private var version: Long = 0
    
    // Check version on concurrent modifications
}
```

## 3. Separate Read Models

```kotlin
@Component
class BikeAvailabilityProjection {
    @EventHandler
    fun on(event: BikeCreated) {
        // Update availability projection
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    fun on(event: BikeRentalRequested) {
        // Mark as reserved
    }
}
```

## 4. Add Idempotency Checks

```kotlin
@CommandHandler
fun handle(command: CreateNewBike, eventAppender: EventAppender) {
    // Check if bike already exists
    // Use message ID for deduplication
}
```

## 5. Clarify Event Ownership
Each event type should be owned by one boundary

Use different event names if same concept appears in multiple contexts
Example: BikeCreatedAndMarkedAvailable vs BikeReturnedAndMarkedAvailable

## Summary
The Jupiter Wheels system has 6 primary consistency boundaries organized around aggregate roots (BikeId and RentalId). The boundaries maintain strong consistency within their scope but rely on eventual consistency across boundaries through event-driven integration.

### Key Strengths:
Clear aggregate identification using @EventTag
Event sourcing enables temporal consistency
Event criteria properly scope state reconstruction

### Key Weaknesses:
Missing saga coordination for complex workflows
Overlapping responsibilities (bike availability)
Some commands/events span multiple boundaries
No explicit compensation logic
Potential race conditions in multi-aggregate reads
