/**
 * Gift Card Aggregate implementing CQRS/Event Sourcing pattern using Axon Framework.
 *
 * <p>This aggregate represents a gift card in the system that can be issued with an initial amount
 * and redeemed in partial amounts until the balance is exhausted. The aggregate follows the
 * event sourcing pattern where state changes are represented as immutable events.</p>
 *
 * <p>Business Rules:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Gift cards must be issued with a positive amount</li>
 *   <li>Redemptions must be for positive amounts</li>
 *   <li>Redemptions cannot exceed the remaining balance</li>
 *   <li>Gift cards maintain their remaining value after redemptions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The aggregate handles the following commands:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link IssueGiftCardCommand} - Creates a new gift card with initial balance</li>
 *   <li>{@link RedeemGiftCardCommand} - Redeems an amount from existing gift card</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The aggregate produces the following events:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link GiftCardIssuedEvent} - Emitted when a gift card is successfully issued</li>
 *   <li>{@link GiftCardRedeemedEvent} - Emitted when an amount is successfully redeemed</li>
 * </ul>
